# Python-Instacard
The grocery store Instacart operates through an app and has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. Through the initial data and exploratory analysis we will derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Data
Open-source data sets from Instacart.“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017.
